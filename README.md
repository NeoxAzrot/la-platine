# La platine

> ⚠️ Not totally finished yet

## What is the turntable?

We wanted to create an audio streaming platform using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

We wanted to play on vinyl, hence the name of our application.

### Responsive

It is a **PWA**, the design has been thought to be viewed on cell phones in priority.

## Our tools

- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/fr/products/illustrator.html)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/fr/products/xd.html)
- [React.js](https://fr.reactjs.org/)
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

## To see the project

### Netlify

You can find the project online directly at the following address [react-weather.netlify.app](https://react-weather.netlify.app)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Then you could see the project without running a `localhost` server.
